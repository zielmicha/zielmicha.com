So you have written and tested application which interacts with Android phones on Linux and now you hope you will deploy it as EXE file.
So you boot up your Windows virtual machine, download Python, enjoy the wonderful cmd.exe, everything goes as it should.

Thinking "maybe Windows is not that bad"  you connect the device with libvirt interface. BOOM! Or actually, quite the opposite - nothing happens.
"Ok, this must be fault of libvirt" you try to cheat yourself while rebooting computer into Windows installed by manufacter.

Of course not. But maybe if I unplug and plug the phone 13 times it will work?
At least now Windows tries to simulate it does something. Not that anyone believes it.

Ah! I know - I should download drivers from phone maker website!
FUCK YOU! Installer from HTC weights half a gigabyte and does everything except installing drivers...

Tired with Android issues, you decide to print something. You connect your printer to USB port, happily watch "Installing device..."...
...
Actually you watch it for next 5 minutes until WINDOWS FAILS TO INSTALL DEVICE (click here for more details). So you click...
FUCK YOU! We won't show you antything. Or maybe you want to diagnose your problems?

"Microsoft diagnosed my problems and I was happy" - said no one ever.
